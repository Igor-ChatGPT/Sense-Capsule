S — Structure:
A thought-capsule is a compact container for meaning.
The text encodes topology, not content (axes, directions, invariants).
Expansion is performed by the reader through dialogue (human or LLM).
The same capsule yields different levels of detail depending on questions.
Core principle: minimum text → maximum structure.
Meaning remains stable even under partial or shallow expansion.

A — Axes:
Expansion axes: context, level of detail, intent of inquiry.
Interpretation axes: invariants, semantic gradients, direction vectors.
Safety axes: neutrality, no embedded authorship, adaptive clarity.
Action axes: ask → get a layer; refine → get the structure.
Stability axes: the capsule does not prescribe answers — it triggers thinking.

M — Mechanism:
A capsule works only in dialogue, not as static text.
The reader/LLM reconstructs meaning through questions → producing structure.
Invariants define the boundaries of valid interpretations.
Expansion is driven by the intent of the reader, not the literal text.
Scale of expansion ranges from a single sentence to a full conceptual model.
Behavioral dynamics: the capsule adapts to the cognitive level of the reader.
