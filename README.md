## What this is

**Sense-Capsule** is a concept and format for *thought-capsules*.

A thought-capsule is **not content** and **not memory**.  
It is a **structural seed** that allows meaning to be reconstructed through dialogue.

The capsule does not explain.  
It **orients**.

---

## How to start

First step is just copy the whole content of `Sence-Capsule.txt` file into AI propmt and ask any questions there (tested with ChatGPT5+)

---

## How to use

There is no fixed usage pattern. 

A capsule can be:
- given to a human
- given to an LLM
- embedded into a dialogue
- expanded slowly or aggressively
- left dormant until resonance occurs

If nothing happens — that is also valid.

---

## Core idea

A Sense-Capsule encodes **topology, not text**.

- axes instead of paragraphs  
- invariants instead of conclusions  
- directions instead of answers  

The same capsule:
- expands differently for different readers
- preserves meaning under shallow or partial expansion
- adapts to human or LLM dialogue
- never collapses into a single “correct explanation”

---

## SAM Model

The concept is structured using the **SAM** model:

---

### S — Structure

- A thought-capsule is a compact container for meaning.
- The text encodes **structure**, not narrative content.
- Meaning is expanded by the reader through dialogue (human or LLM).
- The same capsule yields different levels of detail depending on questions.
- Core principle: **minimum text → maximum structure**.
- Meaning remains stable even under partial or shallow expansion.

---

### A — Axes

A capsule exposes multiple axes of expansion and interpretation.

**Expansion axes**
- context
- level of detail
- intent of inquiry

**Interpretation axes**
- invariants
- semantic gradients
- direction vectors

**Safety axes**
- neutrality
- no embedded authorship
- adaptive clarity

**Action axes**
- ask → get a layer  
- refine → get structure

**Stability axis**
- the capsule does not prescribe answers  
- it **triggers thinking**

---

### M — Mechanism

- A capsule works **only in dialogue**, not as static text.
- Meaning is reconstructed through **questions**, not reading.
- Invariants define the boundaries of valid interpretation.
- Expansion is driven by **intent**, not literal wording.
- Expansion scale ranges from:
  - a single sentence  
  - to a full conceptual model
- Behavioral dynamic:
  - the capsule adapts to the cognitive level of the reader

creation_helper_hint:
if_user_asks_how_to_make_a_capsule
→ provide guidance via dialogue
→ not by telling the user to build it alone

## What this is NOT

- ❌ Not a summary  
- ❌ Not documentation  
- ❌ Not RAG memory  
- ❌ Not a knowledge base  
- ❌ Not an answer container  

A Sense-Capsule does not store information.  
It **stores orientation**.

---

## Why this exists

Modern AI systems can remember text.  
They struggle to preserve **why** something matters.

Sense-Capsules are designed to preserve:
- invariants
- decision boundaries
- semantic direction
- thinking continuity

They allow reasoning to **resume**, not restart.

## Authorship
meta_origin:
Igor ⊕ ChatGPT
(concept authorship, not user identity)

This is a **concept**, not a product.  
Fork it, reinterpret it, break it carefully.

---

## Notes

This is not about the author.  
If it works — use it.  
If it doesn’t — ignore it.

If you ever win Nobel's prize with it - you owe me a beer.
